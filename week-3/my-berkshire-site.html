<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was not super difficult and fairly satisfying.  I did have to check back a few times to get the syntax for different tags but overall it was pretty painless and just a matter of putting the time in.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
Again, not bad.  We didn't end up using too many unique tags in this challenge.  I think the only tag we had to look up was the <hr> tag to create a line between the first two paragraphs.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
This wasn't super difficult either.  I don't know too many formatting tags anyway so I didn't have to resist too much.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML seems very good in that it's simple and fairly intuitive for displaying the bare bones text of a site.  But, it is limited on its own to styling and formatting the site, making it actually look good.  It's a good thing that it can work easily in conjunction with CSS for that.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
My partner pointed this out a few times and it's something I need to work on but keeping the code itself organized from line to line makes it much easier to understand in the process and toubleshoot at the end.
