What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The primary purpose of this site is to serve as an online portfolio for my coding-related work.  It will give basic background and contact information along with a picture on the home page, and then also contain a blog page and a projects page.

What are your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience would hopefully be co-workers as well as current and potential clients.  My site will clearly dsiplay necessary information about myself and my background and then give easy to view examples of my past work.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

Depending on the sort of visitor, it seems like the primary action could be different.  Potential clients might first want to see some of my work or read a blog post, but I would hope they would end their experience wanting to contact me, so it might be a good idea to display contact information at the bottom of each page in the footer.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?  What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

UX is a discipline concerned with how a person feels when interfacing with a system, generally a website or application, and focuses on usbaility, design, accessibility, marketing, system performance, ergonomics, HCI, utility and other human factors.  UX designers look at systems and sub-systems in order to see where websites might be losing users.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I thought a majority of the content in the UX article was unnecessary and overly-detailed and the instructions in release 3 could have been more clear, especially the instructions about using markdown and inline image display.
