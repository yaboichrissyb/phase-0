What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is a sort of bare bones img or lightly interactive representation of the informational hierarchy of a web or desktop application design.  It allows you as a designer to plan the layout and interaction of various site pages without the added distraction of colors, typeface, or precise copy.

What are the benefits of wireframing?

Wireframing helps you solidify your design choices before you move onto a hi-def wireframe or the visual and code components.  It's useful when working with a sutomer/client so you can easily and neatly describe the overall interface you plan to build.

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

It was alright.  At this stage, I haven't done a lot of thinking about the various tools, buttons, menus etc. that can go into a webpage so the two pages I've designed are very basic.

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I used Balsamiq so most of my revisions came after discovering a neater or more appropriate button, box or way of accomplishing what I was after.  The overall design idea I had didn't change much throughout the process though I wasn't able to create a template that looked EXACTLY the way I wanted.

What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

With the help of some of the optional resources I didn't end up having any questions not answered in the material.

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

Navigating Balsamiq for the first time was a bit tedious but I quickly found the interface to be super intuitive and fairly enjoyable.  I enjoyed thinking about these design decisions and using Wirify to look at a few of my most visited websites as wireframes.
